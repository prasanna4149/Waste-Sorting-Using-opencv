# Waste Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of waste materials using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately classify images into categories such as cardboard, compost, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. The dataset used for this project is organized into training and test sets.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a robust model for classifying waste materials.
2. Utilize transfer learning with models like VGG16 and ResNet50.
3. Enhance waste management by providing an automated sorting solution.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Image data augmentation and preprocessing to improve generalization.
- **Visualization**: Dataset visualization to explore data distribution.
- **Model Training**: Training CNNs using TensorFlow and Keras with callbacks like early stopping and model checkpointing.
- **Evaluation**: Analyze model performance with validation metrics.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `opencv-python`
- `Pillow`

Install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras opencv-python Pillow
```

## Dataset
The dataset is organized in the following directory structure:
```
Garbage_Data/
  train/
    cardboard/
    compost/
    glass/
    metal/
    paper/
    plastic/
    trash/
  test/
    cardboard/
    compost/
    glass/
    metal/
    paper/
    plastic/
    trash/
```

- **Training Data**: Used for training the model.
- **Test Data**: Used for evaluating model performance.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure the dataset is in the specified structure.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the project.

## Usage
1. Set up the environment by installing dependencies.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Train the model with the training set.
4. Evaluate the model using the test set.
5. Use the trained model for waste classification.

## Model Architecture
The project uses pre-trained models such as VGG16 and ResNet50 for transfer learning. Custom layers are added on top of the pre-trained models to fine-tune the network for waste classification.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## Future Enhancements
1. Increase dataset size for better generalization.
2. Experiment with additional architectures like Inception or EfficientNet.
3. Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-world use.
